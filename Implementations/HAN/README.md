# Hierarchial Attention Networks for Document Classification

This is a PyTorch implementation of the fantastic HAN Paper from CMU(( ***https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1174.pdf***))

The only modification is that I have swapped out GloVe for Elmo for improved performance


I have also implemented a Streamlit App to interact with the model! ^_^
